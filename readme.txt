 ---- Rules of SVN: ----

* Submit code files only.
  Never commit compile file.
  Delete or exclude "bin" and "build" folder from svn before commiting.

* Build your own packages based on the "programming_standard" model package.
  Make sure to write a header for every code file.
  Make sure to put GNU GPL 2 license inside the root folder of the package.

* No private data.
  Imagine that you uploaded your password, so that everyone can see it but you cannot delete it.

* Use "art_" as the beginning of the package name.
